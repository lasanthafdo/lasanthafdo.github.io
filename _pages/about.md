I am a graduate from the Computer Science & Engineering Department of University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka and currently reading for a master's degree with a major component of research at the same university. My research interests are mainly in distributed systems, parallel programming and data science. My interest in these particular fields can be attributed to [many reasons](#), but if I were to summarise it in a single sentence, the fact that we need specialised algorithms, protocols and coordination mechanisms when computers are working together in a distributed or parallel environment which requires considerable rethinking and redesigning of their sequential counterparts has always fascinated me.

Currently, I work as a senior researcher at the Big Data for Development (BD4D) team at [LIRNEasia](https://lirneasia.net/), where we process large-scale heterogenous datasets (Mobile Network Big Data, Remote sensing data etc.) to derive insights that can help shape public policy, especially in developing nations. One of the projects that I work on at LIRNEasia involves using pseudonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) to capture human movement patterns at regional levels, which is combined with other relevant data sources to build machine learning models that predict dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka. More details on this project as well as other projects done by the BD4D team can be found [here](https://lirneasia.net/big-data).

Before I joined LIRNEasia, I worked as a senior software engineer at [WSO2](https://wso2.com/), where I worked mainly on the [Complex Event Processor](https://wso2.com/products/complex-event-processor/) of the WSO2 middlware platform. While working there, I worked on optimizing the [Siddhi]() real time stream processing engine, introducing distributed stream processing capabilties to our product by integrating with [Apache Storm]() and working on code optimization to [squeeze out that extra bit of latency and throughput](#) from the product.

You can find more information about the stuff I've worked on by having a look at my [CV](#), [publications](#) or [projects](#).
