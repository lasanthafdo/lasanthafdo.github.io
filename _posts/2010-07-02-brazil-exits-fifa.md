Indeed it broke the hearts of many Brazilian fans to see their team exit the soccer world cup finals at the quarter final stages. Brazil were among the tournament favourites from the very beginning and even thought Netherlands was a tough team to compete with, no one could say today's match was an upset result.

South American teams garner a lot of support for themselves, even from neutral fans, not only because of their success at international tournaments, but because of their playing style. They play the game beautifully!. From start to finish, teams like Brazil and Argentina play an open game, and their dribbling skills and control of the ball would keep any fan glued to their play. It is indeed unfortunate to see one such team that has the flair and ability to play it 'joga bonito' style has to exit the tournament at this stage. Yet indeed, I guess it is the nature of football that upsets like these happen.

Many critics have pointed the finger at coach Dunga for veering off from the more attacking and free flowing style of play that has been associated with Brazil so long for a more defensive style of play with fast counter-attacking breaks. Many commentators were saying that Brazil had real steel at the back that counted for a really good defence. However, looking at today's game, it seemed that after the first mistake was allowed to give an own goal to the opponents, Brazilian defence really fell apart. What was notable was that the Brazilian team really lost it after that goal and was unable to put up a composed and fluent period of play whether it be defence or offence. While it was true that Brazil were able to win some or corners and apply pressure to the Dutch penalty area even after being down by one goal, no really smooth moves for which they are famous for never came off to bring them success. Their pinpoint, defence splitting passing was no where to be seen. Even though there were many Brazilian players who tried to crash through with one of their inspiring runs, their skills were suddenly lacking in dribbling and negotiating tackles. The bottom line, the Brazil team wilted away when the pressure was really turned on.

It is indeed a good reminder to us all that talent alone cannot do the job to the finish at all times. Brazil was technically superior with half a dozen stars who had more than enough talent to pull it through for Brazil. But IMHO, they lacked the nerves of steel that is needed to pull you through at times of trouble. In this respect, the Dutch was far superior as they held themselves together to comeback from being one goal down. After seeing so many upset results at the group stages, once again we see what would be called another upset by many. It seems that the norm for this world cup held in the rainbow nation is, teams that play their heart out are always rewarded, more so than the teams who base their play on technical perfection. All in all, the Dutch deserve their win, for never giving up, and for holding it together till the final whistle.
