I met a flower in full bloom today,

Sweet and sexy as hell,

With an airy top and matching tight jeans,

I've never met such an obvious belle.



The designer logo in a tiny print,

Stamped her class on her dress.

I heard her voice when she called one of her lovers,

Oh! Such an exquisite address.



Her painted nails shone an emerald green.

Her sensual curves caressed by a gentle breeze.

Every man there wanted her just as much as me,

But I kept my emotions in a freeze.


Yet her intriguing glance from time to time,

Kindled within me a dormant fire.

As instincts ingrained in my genetics kicked in,

My body began to ache with desire.


She turned my way, with a sly half smile,

Beckoning me into her pleasurable ways.

" If I were to act on these unquenchable needs, 

Aren't our genes to be blamed in the first place? "



Dreaming away in my surreal fantasy,

I drank her curvaceous figure with zeal,

When a tiny voice from afar cried out,

" What of her character, her virtues? Is she worthy beneath her shell? "



Ten points I gave for her cuteness,

And another ten for her seductive skills.

But how much for her wisdom and intellect,

Or integrity, evidently on par with nil.
