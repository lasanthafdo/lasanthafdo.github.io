Human mobility plays a significant role in spatio-temporal propagation of infectious diseases. But how much of an impact does human mobility have on propagating a dengue
outbreak in a dengue endemic country such as Sri Lanka? We show that a proxy value for human mobility, derived from mobile network big data, has a significant correlation with
dengue incidence using past case data. Furthermore, we discuss the applicability of this proxy measure of mobility to increase accuracy of several prediction models based on machine learning techniques. These improved models can be used to do spatio-temporal forecasting of dengue outbreaks which can help medical officers and related governmental or non-governmental agencies execute preemptive measures before the outbreak occurs in actuality.
