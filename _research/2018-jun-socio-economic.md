Usage patterns in calling behaviour as well as movement patterns have been shown to correlate with socio-economic levels. In this project, we use Call Detail Records (CDRs) to derive proxy indicators on mobility, consumption and social behaviours of mobile phone subscribers at a large scale to investigate which indicators correlate most in a Sri Lankan regional context.
